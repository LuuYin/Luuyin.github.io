Greetings! I'm Lu, now serving as a Postdoctoral fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), located in the beautiful Netherlands. Before that, I was a researcher interning at <font color=009f06>Google's NYC office</font>. 


I hold a Ph.D. degree in the data mining group in TU/e, where I was fortunate to be supervised by the esteemed [Prof. Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/) and [Dr. Vlado Menkovski ](https://vlamen.github.io/). I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees at the [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology). 

My research interests include <font color=009f06>#AI Efficiency</font>, <font color=009f06>#Model Sparsity</font>, <font color=009f06>#Large Language Models</font>, <font color=009f06>#AI for Science</font>. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything with me :)
