Greetings! I'm Lu, currently a researcher interning at <font color=009f06>Google's NYC office</font>. I am also serving as a Postdoctoral fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), located in the beautiful Netherlands. 

I hold a Ph.D. degree in the data mining group in TU/e, where I was fortunate to be supervised by the esteemed professors [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/) and [Vlado Menkovski ](https://vlamen.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees at the [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology). 

My research interests include model efficiency , data efficiency and knowledge elicitation and representation.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything with me :)
