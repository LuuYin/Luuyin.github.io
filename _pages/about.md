Hi!  I am Lu, currently a Ph.D. candidate of machine learning in the data mining group at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), the Netherlands, under the supervision of [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/) and [Vlado Menkovski ](https://vlamen.github.io/). 

Before moving to the Netherlands, I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees at the [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology). 

My research interests include model efficiency , data efficiency and knowledge elicitation and representation.
